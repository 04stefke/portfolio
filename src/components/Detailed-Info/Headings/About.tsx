				I’m a 20-year-old front-end engineer passionate about building seamless,
				dynamic user interfaces that blend elegant design with robust
				functionality. With a strong foundation in modern web technologies —
				including <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>,{" "}
				<strong>SASS</strong>, <strong>Material UI</strong>,{" "}
				<strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>ReactJS</strong>, and{" "}
				<strong>Redux</strong> — I specialize in crafting responsive,
				interactive applications that deliver exceptional user experiences.
				<br />
				<br />
				My portfolio features projects like a <strong>Reddit clone</strong> and
				a fully functional <strong>e-commerce platform</strong>, where I
				showcased my ability to develop scalable, feature-rich applications
				while following front-end best practices. I’m especially skilled at
				translating complex UI designs into pixel-perfect, cross-browser
				compatible implementations.
				<br />
				<br />
				Beyond the technical side, I thrive in{" "}
				<strong>collaborative environments</strong> and value{" "}
				<strong>clear communication</strong> and <strong>teamwork</strong> to
				deliver high-quality results. I’m committed to continuous learning and
				stay current with the latest advancements in front-end development.
				<br />
				<br />
				Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active in the gym and tackling coding
				challenges to sharpen my problem-solving skills. I’m excited to keep
				growing, contribute to innovative projects, and bridge the gap between
				design and technology in meaningful ways.
